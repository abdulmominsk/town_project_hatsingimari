			<article>The Brahmaputra (/ˌbrɑːməˈpuːtrə/), called Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, Siang/Dihang River in Arunachal Pradesh and Luit or Dilao in Assam, is a trans-boundary river which flows through China, India and Bangladesh.[a] It is the ninth largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest.

With its origin in the Manasarovar Lake region, near the Mount Kailash, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River,[1] it flows along southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India).[3] It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of the river Ganges in Bangladesh, and finally, after merging with Padma, it becomes the Meghna and from here, it flows as Meghna river before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.[4]

About 1,913.98 mi (3,080.25 km)[1] long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation in the region. The average depth of the river is 38 m (124 ft) and maximum depth is 120 m (380 ft). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in the Spring when the Himalayan snow melts. The average discharge of the river is about 19,800 m3/s (700,000 cu ft/s),[3] and floods can reach over 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s).[5] It is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.[6] It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibits a tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length.

The river drains the Himalayan east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet, is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.

The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often called the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.

The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name. Brahmaputra means "son of Brahma" in Sanskrit (putra means "son").[7</article>

			<article>The tomb of Mir Jumla, the great Mughal General of Emperor Aurangzeb is located at Thakuranbari village on the Assam-Meghalaya border about 8 kms from Ampati.
History has it that Mir Jumla, who was appointed the Governor of Bengal in 1659 by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, invaded Assam heading a vast army. But the difficult terrain and the malaria prone climate of the area took a heavy toll on the Mughal Army. This forced Mir Jumla to retreat during 1663 without having fully accomplished the subjugation of Assam.
Before he could return to Bengal, the general himself was stricken with malaria and succumbed to the disease on the 30th of March 1663 and his mortal remains were buried on a hillock near Thakuranbari in Garo Hills which is being maintained by the local Mazar Sarif committee.
The tomb reflects a remarkably long grave and bears testimony to the tall height of Mir Jumla.</article>

			<article>Maa Kamakya Temple at Thakuranbari was built by a Great Koch King, Narayana. This temple is located on a hillock about 1 km away from Mir-Jhumla’s Tomb. It is said that this temple has a connection to the famous Kamakhya Temple located at Assam. Legend has it that Maa Kamakhya’s body parts were divided into 52 parts and wherever her parts fell, temples are built to honour and worship her. Consequently as the story goes, Maa Kamakya’s navel fell at Thakuranbari and thus the temple came into existence. Apart from the deity of Kamakhya Devi, the compound also houses other temples namely Siva, Durga, Shakti, Hanuman, Santoshi and swammy. Though this temple is small and still unknown, it is an important pilgrimage destination as Hindu devotees and pilgrim from all over india visit the place during important occasions.</article>

			<article>Loreum Ipsum is a dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</article>
